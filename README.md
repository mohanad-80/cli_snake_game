## Features
- **Text-based Interface**: The game uses a simple text-based interface to display the game board.
- **Random Apple Placement**: The apple (food) is placed randomly on the board each time it is eaten.
- **Snake Growth**: The snake grows in length each time it eats an apple.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## How to Play
- Use the **W/A/S/D** keys or the **Arrow keys** to control the direction of the snake.
- The goal is to eat the apples (`&`) that appear on the board.
- Each apple eaten increases the length of the snake.
- Avoid colliding with the walls (`-` and `|`) or the snake's own body (`@`).
- Press **X** or **ESC** to quit the game at any time.
